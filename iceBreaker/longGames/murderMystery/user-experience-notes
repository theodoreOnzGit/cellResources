so this file is here to help me see things from the user point of view

so i come into a game, i want it to be maximum bang for buck
i expect to have fun thinking about clues and solving a murder mystery


part i is creation - 

i want to have fun in this process.
Don't want to think too much

(a templated murder story will be good, and a step by step guide
on setting up a crime scene)

not too complex, but enough to make a challenge

so a template must be there to craft a story

murdereres must also convince people of a counter story so that they won't get
charged...

once the story is crafted, know your roles:

make sure participants know it very well!



part ii is presentation:

the crime scene will be presented.

at (time and place), victim was found

victim was seen last alive at (place) doing (activity)


here are the statements of the people on the scene:


here are the evidences found:

we have x murderes and y innocents..

part iii is solving:

other team will have to solve the murder mystery and get the correct person within
x minutes (yes this is timed)


must present a case for convicting a the murderers.

part iv is the reveal:

present the true story 

winning team is the one who solves the murder mystery the most accurately.

Tie breaker is by time.

You have 30 mins to come up with the story
and 15 minutes for each team to deliberate and solve...




good luck!
