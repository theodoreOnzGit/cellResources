making their powerpoint slides straightaway, and 
once the last player goes into the breakout room, 
the 10 minute timer will start

- once 10 minutes is up, people are booted out of their rooms, each team will elect a representative
to say what is their cost total

- the team with the highest total is meant to share their powerpoint slides via screenshare. 

- At any point in time, if an item is deemed to be out of category, anyone can call for a vote
if more than 75% of the players deem it to be out of the category, that item is cancelled off the list
if less than 25% of the players vote it to be out of the category, the team is disqualified from participating
(if someone wants to call for a vote, ensure to explain this clearly to them, 

items can be struck out regardless of whether they are in the category or not, only the vote matters
democracy yo)
