Game Summary: please state what the game is in one sentence for participants

This is basically charades or hangman, but you are to mute yourself and try to tell us where you come from...

If your country isn't obvious, we'll guess your country, otherwise we will try to guess the name of your city

	- Be on Zoom and be Muted
	- Optional (hangman mode: share screen)


3) Physical materials (please state what physical materials participants need to get ready

	- nil

4) Game instructions (please state steps for the game)

	- so this is hangman but we're guessing your country or city or where you come from
	- if your country is obvious, you must use your city name, or town name, somewhere we don't know
	- we will be guessing each's person place individually
	- when it's your turn to have your city/place guessed,
	
	- say your name first
	- tell us how many letters and words there are in your country/place of residence
	- the person will then try to communicate the letters or clues showing where he/she is from
	- we can then guess letters or guess the place directly
	- each wrong guess takes one try
	- each person is limited to five tries
	
	- once the city is correctly guessed or we run out of tries, then the person should say
	- which city he/she is from
	- what is one of your favourite things to do in that city/place


	- game master will then demonstrate one round

HANGMAN MODE:

 
	- in hangman mode, the game master will share screen with the everyone to show a hangman
	- this is equivalent to 10 tries
	- four lines will be used to draw the gallows
	- one circle and 5 lines will be used for the stick figure (total 10)
	 

TIMED MODE:

	- instead of giving a fixed number of tries,
	- give each person one minute to have the people guess your place






5) Time limit

	- this game should not take longer than 15 mins
	- which means that each person can take 1-2 minutes if we have about 5 people sharing
	- if not everyone has the time to share, we can have the following people share:
	- 2 international students (new guests)
	- 1 international student volunteer (game master or otherwise for demonstration)
	- 1 non-student volunteer (or leader)
	- 4 people should be enough to cut the time short
	


Last Step: Contingency Plan... (what if something goes wrong, wet weather etc)

	- disconnect halfway
	if a person disconnects halfway, we will move on to the next person
	when the person reconnects, he/she will then share what city/place he/she is from
	after the current person finishes his turn
