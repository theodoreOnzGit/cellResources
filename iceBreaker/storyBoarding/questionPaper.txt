You find yourself waking up in the backseat of a car. As you open your eyes, you can barely make out the shapes in front of you.

Their head are bleeding profusely and they seem to be unresponsive. 

As you try to get a sense of what is going on, you notice a sharp pain in your left hand. There, a piece of glass is lodged into your palm.
