This is the instruction file for participants ... 

Game Summary: please state what the game is in one sentence for participants

1) Grouping instructions (please state how members will group themselves)

people can be individually grouped or play in teams of two-three to save time

ideally 10 people or 10 people groups would be good.

the game itself should take about 3-5 minutes, but going through the answers is about...

10 people(answers) * 12 qns * 5s (to discuss per question) = 10 -20 minutes

2) Web Resources and other materials... (please state how zoom, electronic devices or other websites are used)

Just use a google form,

there will be 13 survey questions

1 name 

and 12 categories, you can just name it category 1 to 12

should be done over zoom, if in person, then phone should be available.



3) Physical materials (please state what physical materials participants need to get ready

none, except computer and phone

4) Game instructions (please state steps for the game)

For the participants:

the aim of the game is to come up with words or phrases for each given category that the host reads out

if there is someone who has an answer too similar in meaning to you
(up to the host how strict you want to be on that)

those answers will not count for scores

the host will then go through each of the answers via screenshare, and see who scores the most!

For the host:


as the host, you are to give 12 categories for people to fill in

Ask them to fill things in accordingly in the forms, names, and answers

so this is 13 questions in total, 1 for name, 12 for each category

the categories are in the Question paper file

so share with them the link to your google form

then start reading out the categories 1-12

(use an excel type sheet to copy and paste answers from the google form, if the answers are
duplicates, then cut and paste it to the bottom)

once everybody is submitted, copy and paste the results of the google form into another spreadsheet

cut and paste answers which are duplicates or irrelevant

use the countA function to score each participant!

after that of course, you can save the file for records.
