1) Grouping instructions (please state how members will group themselves)

Split team into two groups (more if there are more than 20 pax)

zoom with anotate OR

3) Physical materials (please state what physical materials participants need to get ready

paper and pen/pencil

4) Game instructions (please state steps for the game)

group into groups of two (choose a drawing person from each team)

both teams are given a picture, and it will be the same picture.
So if the picture is a rocketship, team A and team B's drawing person is told it is a rocketship.

each team's drawing person will draw on the same piece of paper or annotate
but they will take turns to draw one stroke each

so team A's person draws one stroke, then both teams guess
then team B's person draws another stroke, then both teams guess
repeat this cycle

after each stroke is drawn

each team is allowed to guess what it is no matter who is drawing
depending on who guesses the answer right, points are awarded to that team

each person's drawing lead should draw in such a way only their team can guess
and the other team cannot guess what the picture is

repeat to heart's content


5) Time Requirement (ice breakers tend to be time sensitive, so state roughly how long the game will take)

depends how long the game is desired to run. min 5-10 mins, but depends how many pictures you want to guess

Last Step: Contingency Plan... (what if something goes wrong, wet weather etc)

indoor game, no wet weather plan needed.

Reviews: After playing a round of games, how did the game go and what changes do we need to make
