This is the instruction file for participants ... 

Game Summary: please state what the game is in one sentence for participants


is basically a self introduction game. More of fill in the blanks


fill in the blank style

a) my favourite ____ is _____ because _____

so it could be
- activity
- season
- time of day


But with a twist or two,

you cannot repeat previous answers, or be too similar (up to group to define what "too similar" is)

and also, if it is your turn to answer the question,
and the timer stops, you are eliminated along with the last person who answered


1) Grouping instructions (please state how members will group themselves)

individual game

2) Web Resources and other materials... (please state how zoom, electronic devices or other websites are used)

timer

3) Physical materials (please state what physical materials participants need to get ready

nil-

timer or watch

4) Game instructions (please state steps for the game)

in our group, each person shares How they will fill in the blank. Try to be truthful

however, no other person can repeat the answer that the last person uses, or be too similar


And after which, the person must pick another one to answer.

that's the basic idea

Now if you are familiar with this, then we going to add a 30 second timer.

If you haven't finished filling in the blanks and calling the next person,
the "parcel" explodes, eliminating you and the previous person who was answering

"y'know, splash damage"

repeat until last man/woman standing

should take 10 mins or less, 

Last Step: Contingency Plan... (what if something goes wrong, wet weather etc)
