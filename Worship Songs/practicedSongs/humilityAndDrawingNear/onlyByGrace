Verse
Only by grace can we enter 
Only by grace can we stand 
Not by our human endeavour 
But by the blood of the Lamb 
Into Your presence You call us 
You call us to come 
Into Your presence You draw us 
And now by Your grace we come 
And now by Your grace we come 
 
Chorus
Lord if You marked our transgressions 
who would stand 
Thanks to Your grace we are cleansed 
by the blood of the Lamb 
Lord if You marked our transgressions 
who would stand 
Thanks to Your grace we are cleansed 
by the blood of the Lamb 
 
Verse
Only by grace can we enter 
Only by grace can we stand 
Not by our human endeavour 
But by the blood of the Lamb 
Into Your presence You call us 
You call us to come 
Into Your presence You draw us 
And now by Your grace we come 
And now by Your grace we come
