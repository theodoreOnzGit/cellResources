Singable Key: A

I will keep my eyes on the Lord
I will keep my eyes on the Lord
With Him by my side I will not be shaken
Therefore my tongue will rejoice
My heart is glad in Your holy presence
Where there is fullness of joy
I say You are, You are
You are my Lord
I have nothing, nothing good beside you
You are, You are
You are my Lord
I have nothing good beside You
Where there is fullness of joy
Where there is fullness of joy
