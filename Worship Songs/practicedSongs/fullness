Fullness by Elevation Worship

(singble key: A, original C)

Fullness of eternal promise
Stirring in your sons and daughters
Earth revealing heavenâ€™s wonders
Spirit come
Spirit come

What you spoke is now unfolding
All your children shall behold it
Dreams awaken in this moment
Spirit come
Spirit come

Pour it out
Let your love run over
Here and now 
Let your glory fill this house

Pour it out
Let your love run over
Here and now
Let your glory fill this house

Now the world awaits your presence
And this power is within us
We will rise to be your witness
Spirit come
Spirit come

Pour it out
Let your love run over
Here and now
Let your glory fill this house (x2)

Tongues of fire
Testifying of the Son
One desire
Spirit come
Spirit come
Speak revival
Prophesy like it is done
One desire
Spirit come
Spirit come (x2)

Let our hearts continue burning
For our King is soon returning
As we hold to this assurance
Spirit come
Spirit come

Pour it out
Let your love run over
Here and now
Let your glory fill this house (x2)

Tongues of fire
Testifying of the Son
One desire
Spirit come
Spirit come
Speak revival
Prophesy like it is done
One desire
Spirit come
Spirit come
