Singable Key: G 

What can wash away my sin?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
What can make me whole again?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

For my pardon this I see
Nothing but the blood of Jesus!
For my cleansing this my plea
Nothing but the blood of Jesus!

Oh! Precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

This is all my hope and peace
Nothing but the blood of Jesus!
This is all my righteousness
Nothing but the blood of Jesus!

Oh! Precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

Glory glory this I see
Nothing but the blood of Jesus!
All my praise for this I bring
Nothing but the blood of Jesus!

Oh! Precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

Oh! Precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
