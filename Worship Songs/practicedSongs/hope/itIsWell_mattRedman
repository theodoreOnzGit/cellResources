E		B
Our scars are a sign

	A
Of grace in our lives

			C#m	B
Oh Father, how you brought us through
 
E		B
When deep were the wounds
		A
And dark was the night
		C#m		B
The promise of your love you proved
 
C#m 		B	G#m
Now every battle still to come

	A
Let this be our song

	B 
It is well (it is well)

	E
With my soul (with my soul)
	A	C#m	B	E
It is well, it is well with my soul
 
Weeping may come
Remain for a night
But joy will paint the morning sky
 
You're there in the fast
You're there in the feast
Your faithfulness will always shine
 
Now every blessing still to come
Let this be our song
 
It is well (it is well)
With my soul (with my soul)
It is well, it is well with my soul
I trust your ways (trust your ways)
I trust your name (trust your name)
It is well, it is well with my soul

You lead us through battles
(You lead us through battles)

C#m
You lead us to blessing
(you lead us to blessing)

A
And you make us fruitful
(and you make us fruitful)

In the land of our suffering, God

	F#m 	A	B	E 
It is well, it is well with my soul
 
It is well (it is well)
With my soul (with my soul)
It is well, it is well with my soul
I trust your ways (I trust your ways)
I trust your name (I trust your name)
It is well, it is well with my soul
It is well, it is well with my soul
 
It is well (it is well)
With my soul (with my soul)
It is well, it is well with my soul
I trust your ways (I trust your ways)
I trust your name (I trust your name)
It is well, it is well with my soul
