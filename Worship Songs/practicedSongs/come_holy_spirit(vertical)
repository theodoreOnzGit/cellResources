VERSE
        C#m                      E
I wanna hear the power of your Word
         B                        A
I wanna feel the weight of glory fall
        C#m                  E
I wanna know the One who overcomes
         B               F#m
I wanna see, I wanna be undone


CHORUS
 A                  B
Come, Holy Spirit, come
                C#m                E  B
Rush in like a flood, Heaven, open up
 A                      B               C#m                  
Come, in never ending waves, I am swept away
               E   B
Holy Spirit, come


VERSE
        C#m                        E
I wanna hear the voice the storm obeys
         B                           A
I wanna feel your presence in this place
        C#m                        E
I wanna know a pure and righteous love
         B                F#m  
I wanna see, I wanna be undone


BRIDGE
  A    B
Come, come
C#m
Fall afresh on me
  E            B
Fall afresh on me

   A
Nothing else
                B
Nothing else I know
  C#m
Nothing else
                     E     B
Nothing else comes close
