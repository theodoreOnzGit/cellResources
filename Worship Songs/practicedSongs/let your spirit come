Verse


Let your Spirit come

Let your will be done

Let your presence fall on me

Christ you've set me free

you're my liberty

let your presence fall on me


Chorus

Let the power of the holy Ghost fall in this place

Come and change my heart renew me with your mercy and your grace

let the love of Christ surround me

Come closer to my side

Let your Spirit Fall on me
