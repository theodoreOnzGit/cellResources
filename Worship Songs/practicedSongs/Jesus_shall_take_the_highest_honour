Jesus shall take the highest honour
Jesus shall take the highest praise
Let all earth join heaven in exalting
The Name which is above all other names

Let’s bow the knee in humble adoration
For at His name every knee must bow
Let every tongue confess He is Christ, God’s only Son
Sovereign Lord, we give You glory now

Chorus:

For all honour and blessing and power
Belongs to You, belongs to You
All honour and blessing and power
Belongs to You, belongs to You
Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the living God
